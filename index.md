=================================================

# County-based multi-member Congressional districts

## Assumptions
  
Congressional districts are contiguous, compact, and of equivalent population.  
County boundaries delimit US Congressional districts.  
Congressional districts have one or more members.
## Approach
  
Exhaustively specify every combination of single and multi-member districts.  
Partition the graph of a State's adjacent counties into contiguous single and multi-member districts.  
Prefer districts with fewer members.  
Prefer districts with smallest deviation in population from average.
